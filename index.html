        <strong>Notes:</strong>
        <br />
        The a priori for this project is the planning itself. Contains basic features and structural elements such as date information, time period, and sections.
        <br />
        The general daily planner prior starter I used that created by Chatgpt: <a href="/Generator_Assignment/priori/index.html">link to the priori</a>
        <br />
        <strong>Description:</strong>
        <br />
        By default, the generator will randomly layout based on the tasks you add. Of course, you can also set it to a fixed time. 
        <br />
        In addition, users can modify the seed for random task times. After completion, players can also download the schedule.
        <br />
        <strong>Meets additional challenges:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>Challenge 2: Providing users with the ability to download generated schedules in cvs form</li>
          <li>Challenge 3: Using seeds to manipulate the random.</li>
        </ul>
